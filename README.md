# EMNIST-letters

This repository contains a CNN model on the EMNIST dataset from 
https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset 

I have used the matlab format dataset. 

I was able to achieve 93.13% test accuracy. It seems to be possible to get a higher accuracy by training for some more epochs but at the risk of overfitting. To get a much better score we would need to change the model. I would love to hear your opinions on this.
